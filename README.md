# What if you had to read an article before you commented on it?
Generating efficient reading recall tests and basic understanding (topics, authorship, etc).

## Vision
If we set aside profit for a moment and explore the space of meaningful online discourse, how would we build it?

Comprende could be part of a suite of tools and libraries that power ethical social media and news platforms. Here's a few ideas that occur to me when I think about a multi-pronged approach to building a place to have great conversations online:

1. encourage and reward reading linked articles before joining discussions
    - privelege responses of folks who opened the link
    - privelege responses of folks who answer some basic recall questions about the linked resource (comprende!)
    - priveleging such responses could include influence on ranking algorithms, as well as badges on responses for opening articles and completing quizes

2. slow down heated discussions and intervene when sentiment turns ugly
    - intercept vitriol and anger with techniques like sentiment detection. when a participant is upset, encourage them to *cool off*.
    - encourage people to get up from their computer when they've been using your platform for too long

3. humanize participants
    - encourage/require folks to use their real identities. people behave better when they are not anonymous
